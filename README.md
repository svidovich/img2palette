Some kind of data project, as coded on my raspberry pi.


## Requirements

We require:
- Pillow, for opening and processing images
- Scikit Learn, for clustering

We use numpy. Since it's a dependency of scikit-learn, we're not specifying it; we're going to use the version that comes with our pinned sklearn version.
